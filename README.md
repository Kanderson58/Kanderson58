# Kara Anderson - Front End Software Developer

---

### ___About Me:___ 
:sparkles: I am a Turing student in the process of learning front end software development.  I am passionate about beautiful, useable, accessible web design that's intuitive for every user.  I enjoy the challenge of a new problem to solve, and have an attention to detail that makes me well suited for my role as a developer.

:sparkles: I am currently learning React, Typescript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

:sparkles:  My current project in development is my solo project, Puppy Playdate, which was created as a solution to a real-life problem in my community.  The park in my neighborhood is the perfect place for my dog to meet up with all his best doggy friends.  When his best friend Tucker's owner moved out of the neighborhood, he was so sad!  I knew I had to find a way to keep Tucker included in our park playdates, but between chaotic schedules and the tempermental Colorado weather, there was no way to schedule regular playdates.  That's where the Playdate site comes in!  With a single click, I can let all my dog's best friends know that we'll be at the park.  I can plan events, meet new dog friends (and human friends), ask advice, and coordinate with other park goers so we all get to use the space.
